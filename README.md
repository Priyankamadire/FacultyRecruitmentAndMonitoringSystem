Project Title: Faculty Recruitment And Monitoring System
Category: Web Technologies
Technologies used: MERN, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap
Problem Statement:
Create a web app which will indicate the future vacancies and positions for proper planning and recruitment of faculty. All the data of faculties who are retiring or leaving the institute should be updated in the app and simultaneously faculties who are available for that position and who are ready to join should be notified. This would help to decrease the manual search for faculty and automatically find and contact the faculties who are interested to join. In addition to this, a notification system should be in place for notifying the faculty of new positions available and their status change.
