Project Title: Faculty Recruitment And Monitoring System

Category: Web Technologies

Technologies used: MERN, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap

Problem Statement:
Create a web app which will indicate the future vacancies and positions for proper planning and recruitment of faculty. All the data of faculties who are retiring or leaving the institute should be updated in the app and simultaneously faculties who are available for that position and who are ready to join should be notified. This would help to decrease the manual search for faculty and automatically find and contact the faculties who are interested to join. In addition to this, a notification system should be in place for notifying the faculty of new positions available and their status change.

AND INSTALL FOLLOWING PACKAGES AT CLIENT SIDE

"axios"

"bower"

"init"


"react"

"react-dom" 

"react-scripts"

  AFTER INSTALLING THESE PACKAGES TO CONNECT BACKEND WITH DATABASE 
  
  nodemon app.js  Using nodemon (if we want the server to automatically restart when you make changes)
  
  (or)
  
  node app.js   Using node (if we don't need automatic restarts)
  
once database and backend connected at port 5000

Another side react app runs on port 3000

to run project use

npm start (or) yarn start
With both the backend and frontend servers running,
you can access your web application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000. Your React frontend will be hosted there. It can make requests to your Node.js backend, typically at http://localhost:5000, using API endpoints you've defined in your backend code.
